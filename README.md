# Usage
No sign-in required, it communicates with riot client and riot games.

**Make sure VALORANT is _closed_, and riot client is running.**

Click "Load from account" to load from your riot account. This essentially takes a snapshot of your current game settings that you can load at a future time.
Note: sharing will be added in the future
